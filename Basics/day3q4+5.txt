Q4. If we have only 4 bits, How 3 and -6 will be written in 4 bits.
    3 = 0011
    -6 = 1010

    Rough:
    6 in Binary 110
    1s Complement 001
    2s Complement 010
    i.e. -6 = 1010

Q5. If we have only 5 bits, How 13 and -16 will be written in 5 bits.
    13 = 01101
    -16 = 10000

    Rough:
    16 in Binary 10000
    1s Complement 01111
    2s Complement 10000
